Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a powerful and free version control tool that helps us keep track of our code. Also, it allows for collaboration between peers and permits users to build things in different branches and merge them together to minimize errors in code. For basic users, it is a great way to keep your project files backed up in case the local files get altered or deleted in some way.
