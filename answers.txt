Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a powerful and free version control tool that helps us keep track of our code. Also, it allows for collaboration between peers and permits users to build things in different branches and merge them together to minimize errors in code. For basic users, it is a great way to keep your project files backed up in case the local files get altered or deleted in some way.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science is used in a plethora of different use cases in the software industry. More specifically, it can be used in motorsports. There, developers can collect large amounts of data from sensors on a racecar, including telemetry, fuel consumption, and even tire performance. This way, teams will be able to optimize their car and make predictions as to what their racecar needs to perform the best it can during raceday.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: The difference between merging and rebasing is that merging combines branches with a new merge commit, preserving both original branches. Rebasing rewrites history, essentially overwriting the files that are overlapped. In this example, rebasing would have overwritten answers.txt.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: This semester, I am looking forward to learning valuable lessons in data science that will help me in getting into the automotive software industry. Telemetry is a large topic in this space, so learning data science fundamentals will help me gain a solid understanding of the industry.
